I am a first year student in Ruia College, Mumbai studying physics, with 
mathematics and computer science as ancillary subjects. My primary interests
include computational and theoretical approach to physics, with a propensity
for astrophysics. Study of gravitation particularly interests me, hence my 
interest in projects involving gravitational lensing. Due to my interest in 
theoretical aspect of physics as well, I usually read and study in my free 
time. I pursue programming as a hobby - Project Euler proves to be a good 
way to polish my skills. I also like long walks as a mode of recreation.
I prefer to work primarily during the night hours in local time. After
completion of my second semester in early April, I have no particular time
commitments and intend to focus on this project. 

I'm proficient in C, C++ and Python, and I've used shell scripting on numerous
occassions. I also have some experience with Octave. I'm also comfortable with 
git, though I have no experience with other SCMs.

I currently use Arch Linux with spectrwm as the window manager: I prefer to 
use keyboard over mouse as far as possible. A high school computer science
teacher suggested that I switch to Linux, from Windows, due to my interest
in programming. I've used quite a few distributions of Linux before settling
down on Arch Linux: Puppy, Ubuntu, Mint, Debian, Gentoo. I've also followed 
the Linux From Scratch guides to build a working Linux system from source code,
which allowed me to understand the internals of Linux. I also operate a home 
server on a Raspberry Pi running Arch Linux for my personal use. I'm quite
comfortable with virtualization - especially VirtualBox, though I presonally
use qemu directly due to my disposition for text interfaces.
